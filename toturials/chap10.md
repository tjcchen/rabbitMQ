## Exchange to Exchange Routing

The Exchange to Exchange Routing pattern in RabbitMQ is a way to route messages from one exchange to another exchange based on a routing key. This pattern is useful when you want to route messages from one exchange to another exchange based on a routing key.


## The Header Exchange

A headers exchange routes messages to queues based on the message's header attributes, not the routing key. This allows for more flexible and complex routing logic than other exchange types.


## How Header Exchange Works

Instead of a routing key, a headers exchange uses a set of key-value pairs in the message header for routing decisions. A queue is bound to the exchange with its own set of key-value pairs.

The routing logic depends on a special binding argument called x-match. This argument can have two values:

- `all` (default): The message is routed to the queue only if all of the headers in the queue's binding match the headers in the message. This is like a logical AND operation.

- `any`: The message is routed to the queue if at least one of the headers in the queue's binding matches a header in the message. This is like a logical OR operation.
