#
# Accept and Reject Messages
# In RabbitMQ, once a consumer receives a message from a queue, it must decide what to do with it.
# The two key actions are accept (acknowledge) and reject (nack/reject).
#
# Typical Use:
# - Accept: after successful processing.
# - Reject/Nack with requeue=true: temporary failure (try again later).
# - Reject/Nack with requeue=false: permanent failure (e.g., bad data) â†’ send to Dead Letter Queue.
